# BM6 BLE Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for integrating actual BLE communication using BleakClient with the BM6 battery monitoring devices in the Battery Hawk system.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- **BLEConnectionPool**: Currently has stub implementation in `_create_connection` method
- **BM6Device**: Has complete protocol layer but uses placeholder BLE operations
- **Dependencies**: Bleak ^1.0.1 already included in pyproject.toml
- **Crypto**: AES encryption/decryption fully implemented in `BM6Crypto`
- **Protocol**: Command building and data parsing implemented

### BM6 Protocol Details
Based on analysis of reference implementations:
- **Service UUID**: `0000fff0-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **Write Characteristic**: `0000fff3-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **Notify Characteristic**: `0000fff4-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- **Encryption**: AES-ECB with key "legend" + 0xFF + 0xFE + "0100009"
- **Communication Pattern**:
  1. Connect via BleakClient
  2. Write encrypted command to FFF3
  3. Subscribe to notifications on FFF4

## Technical Implementation Details

### BleakClient Integration Pattern
```python
async def _create_connection(self, device_address: str) -> dict:
    """Create actual BLE connection using BleakClient."""
    try:
        client = BleakClient(device_address, timeout=self.connection_timeout)
        await client.connect()
        
        # Verify connection and services
        if not client.is_connected:
            raise BLEConnectionError(f"Failed to connect to {device_address}")
            
        conn = {
            "device_address": device_address,
            "client": client,
            "connected_at": time.time(),
            "notifications": {}  # Track active notifications
        }
        
        self.active_connections[device_address] = conn
        return conn
        
    except Exception as e:
        self.logger.error(f"BLE connection failed for {device_address}: {e}")
        raise
```

### Notification Handling Pattern
```python
async def start_notifications(self, device_address: str, char_uuid: str, callback):
    """Start notifications for a characteristic."""
    conn = self.active_connections.get(device_address)
    if not conn or not conn["client"].is_connected:
        raise BLEConnectionError(f"No active connection for {device_address}")
        
    client = conn["client"]
    await client.start_notify(char_uuid, callback)
    conn["notifications"][char_uuid] = callback
```

### BM6 Device Integration Pattern
```python
async def connect(self) -> None:
    """Connect to BM6 device and set up notifications."""
    await super().connect()
    
    # Set up notifications for BM6 data
    await self.connection_pool.start_notifications(
        self.device_address,
        BM6_NOTIFY_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID,
        self._notification_handler
    )
    
    # Request initial data
    await self.request_voltage_temp()

async def request_voltage_temp(self) -> None:
    """Send actual encrypted command to BM6."""
    command = build_voltage_temp_request()  # Already implemented
    await self.connection_pool.write_characteristic(
        self.device_address,
        BM6_WRITE_CHARACTERISTIC_UUID,
        command
    )
```

## Reference Implementation Analysis

### Key Insights from BM6 Examples

From the reference implementations, the BM6 communication pattern is:

1. **Device Discovery**: Scan for devices with name "BM6"
2. **Connection**: Use BleakClient with 30-second timeout
3. **Command Sending**: Write encrypted command to FFF3 characteristic
4. **Notification Setup**: Subscribe to FFF4 characteristic
5. **Data Processing**: Decrypt notifications and parse hex data
6. **Cleanup**: Stop notifications and disconnect

### Critical Implementation Notes

- **AES Key**: Must use exact key `[108, 101, 97, 103, 101, 110, 100, 255, 254, 48, 49, 48, 48, 48, 48, 57]`
- **Encryption Mode**: AES-CBC with 16-byte zero IV (examples show this pattern)
- **Command Format**: "d15507" + padding to 16 bytes, then encrypt
- **Response Format**: Encrypted 16-byte blocks, decrypt then parse hex
- **Data Parsing**:
  - Voltage: bytes 15-18 (hex) / 100
  - Temperature: bytes 8-10 (hex), sign from bytes 6-8
  - SoC: bytes 12-14 (hex)

### Error Handling Patterns

From the examples:
- Use try/except blocks around all BLE operations
- Handle connection timeouts gracefully
- Retry logic for failed connections
